Different Clustering Algorithms
--------------------------------

Partition Based: k-means, k-medoids, CLARANS.
Hierarcical Based: Agnes, Diana, BIRCH, ROCK, CHAMELEON.
Density Based: DBScan, OPTICS, DenClue.
Grid Based: STING, WaveCluster, CLIQUE
Model Based: EM, SOM, CobWeb
Frequent Pattern Based: pCluster
User-Guided or Constraint Based: COD(obstacles), constrained clustering.

Single Link:
+ Can Handle non-elliptical shapes
- Sensitive to noise and outliers
- Chain like clusters

Complete Link:
+ Less susceptible to noise and outliers
- Tends to break large clusters
- Biased towards spherical clusters


Group Average: (Compromise between Single and Complete link)
+ Less susceptible to noise and outliers
- Biased towards spherical cluster

Hierarchical Method: Space complexity O(n*n), Time complexity O(n*n*n)

DBScan : Worst Case O(n*n), O(nlgn) with kd-trees
+ Resistant to noise
+ Can handle clusters of different shapes and sizes
- Problemetic for Varying Densities
- Problemetic for High-dimensional data

OPTICS:
+ Easy interpretation of clustering result
+ Allows (visually guided) cluster exploration.
+ Does not require the number of clusters to be known in advance
+ Computes a complete hierarchy of clusters
